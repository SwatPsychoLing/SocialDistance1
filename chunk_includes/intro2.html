 Just to review, this is how the experiment goes:
</p>

<p>
  1. A series of dashes will appear and you press the spacebar to progress through the passage.
</p>

<p>
  2. Read at a natural rate, comprehending what you read.

</p>

<p>
  3. Press the spacebar again when you come to the end of the passage and a question will appear. 
</p>
  
<p>
  4. Answer the question by clicking on a rating between “1” for not natural at all and “7” for completely natural

</p>
  <p>
  5. After you have answered the question, a screen will automatically appear asking you to click to continue. </p>
<p>
  After the first part of the study is complete, you will see a link to the second part of the experiment.
