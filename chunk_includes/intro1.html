<p class="p1">Welcome. This experiment consists of one part, which should take 10-15 minutes.</p>
<p class="p1">For this part of the experiment, you will read a series of passages. Following each passage, you will be asked to judge how naturally certain pronouns refer to people or things. 
</p>
<p class="p1"> Read the sentence. When you are done reading the sentence, hit the spacebar and a question will appear. The question will ask you to judge how naturally a given pronoun in the sentence refers to something mentioned in the sentence. When the question appears, you should click on a rating between “1” for not natural at all and “7” for completely natural. </p>
<p class="p1"><b>Your honest judgments are important, so please take this seriously.</b></p>
